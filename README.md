# SkyMobile

SkyMobile is a remake of the original SkyMobile_iOS. SkyMobile is cross platform and is now supported on android.

SkyMobile has all the features of SkyMobile_iOS and more!

SkyMobile is also 1.5x faster than SkyMobile_iOS *(tests were on an iPhone 7+)* and packs in a bunch more error checking features to make sure your information is shown without error.
